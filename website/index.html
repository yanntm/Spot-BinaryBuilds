This page hosts the latest build of Spot : 
<ul>
<li>Spot (see <a href="https://spot.lrde.epita.fr/">Spot homepage</a>)</li>
</ul>
These artifacts are not very portable, they're used in our build system, so are specific to the versions (gcc, glibc...) that live on travis-ci (Linux, OSX targets) or AppVeyor (Windows target).
The build is configured to only build what we depend upon, we don't aim to build all of Spot in this build.
